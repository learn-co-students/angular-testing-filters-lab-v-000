# Testing dataset Filters

## Objectives

- Write a unit test to test filter integration

## Instructions

In this repo we've got the same setup as our last lab. We've got a `ContactController` with 150 contacts in it.

Let's test out that we can filter this large dataset.

Add the following tests to check our filtered list for different aspects of our contacts.  

1. Write a test to return all the contacts who are female (hint: there are 71 females). 
2. Write another test to select people from different geographical locations (hint: there are 8 from Manchester).
